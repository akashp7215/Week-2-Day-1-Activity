    <h1>My Favorite Animal</h1>
    <br>
    <p>When it comes to choosing a favorite animal, I would have to go with dogs. There are numerous benefits of owning a pet dog including stress reduction, happier life, and being more sociable. These types of benefits have an overall impact on our own health and we can dramatically improve our mood and quality of life with our furry friend.</p>
